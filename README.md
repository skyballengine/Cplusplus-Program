# Project Summary
This app was written for CS-210 at SNHU and takes input($ value, % interest rate, investment term) from the user to calculate the interest returns and total balance based on MONTHLY COMPOUNDING INTEREST.  Output is 2 tables: one with monthly contributions and the other without monthly contributions.

# What Do I Remember From This Project
It was fun formatting the tables and figuring it all out :)
